# node-pandoc-katex

Very simple pandoc filter to prerender LaTeX math using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/). You just need to load the `katex.css` (or `katex.min.css`) file; with pandoc, this is done with `--css=katex.min.css` assuming `katex.min.css` is in the working directory. You can get the css file from <https://katex.org/docs/browser.html>.
